# Walmart_store_sales_forecasting Project

### Motivation
The motivation of this project is to apply data science and machine learning skills to analyze Walmart_store_sales_forecasting data from Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/overview

### Description of Walmart recruiting competition
One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. If Christmas comes but once a year, so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line.
In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.
